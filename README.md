# Turbot Guardrails Samples Repo

The Turbot Guardrails Samples Repo provides teams using [Turbot Guardrails](https://turbot.com/guardrails) automation and configuration-as-code examples for effective management of Guardrails for their organization.


## Download these examples

```shell
git clone https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples.git
```

## GraphQL API
Includes working examples, queries and integrations written using the Guardrails GraphQL API. It's intended as a resource for developers to use as a starting point for your own integrations.


## Control Objectives
Includes policy configurations (including some calculated policies) for implementing best-practice control objectives across cloud service platforms and services.  The Control Objectives are implemented with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), allowing you to manage and provision Guardrails with a repeatable, idempotent, versioned infrastructure-as-code approach.


## Baselines
Baselines provide a starting point for the most common configuration templates needed when creating a new Turbot Guardrails workspace or onboarding a cloud provider resource into Guardrails.  Baselines are implemented with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), allowing you to manage and provision Turbot Guardrails with a repeatable, idempotent, versioned infrastructure-as-code approach.

## Calculated Policies
Provides templates for implementing calculated policies. Calculated policies allow Guardrails administrators to modify or extend the default behavior and logic that Guardrails uses to evaluate controls. The calculated policy examples are implemented with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) allowing you to manage and provision Turbot Guardrails with a repeatable, idempotent, versioned infrastructure-as-code approach.
