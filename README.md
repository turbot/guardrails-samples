# Turbot Development Kit

The Turbot Development Kit (tdk) provides governance architects and developers automation and configuration-as-code resources for effective management of governance at scale for their organization.

## GraphQL API
Includes working examples, queries and integrations written using the Turbot GraphQL API. It's intended as a resource for developers to use as a starting point for your own integrations.


## Control Objectives
Includes policy configurations (including some calculated policies) for implementing best-practice control objectives across cloud service platforms and services.  The Control Objectives are implemented with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), allowing you to manage and provision Turbot with a repeatable, idempotent, versioned infrastructure-as-code approach.


## Baselines
Baselines provide a starting point for the most common configuration templates needed when creating a new Turbot workspace or onboarding a cloud provider resource into Turbot.  Baselines are implemented with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), allowing you to manage and provision Turbot with a repeatable, idempotent, versioned infrastructure-as-code approach.
