# Description
# -----------
#
# The mutation query import GCP project to a Turbot Folder. The mutation query works as in 2 step.
# STEP 1 is to create a GCP project inside the Turbot Folder.
# STEP 2 is to use the Turbot ID that is returned from STEP 1 as resource ID for setting client email and privet key.

# Prerequisites
# -------------
#
# Create a service account in IAM for the project that needs to be imported. 
# After the service account has been created, assign the following roles: owner,viewer,Pub/Sub Admin and Logging Admin.
# Generate an access key for the service account. Once you select the key format as 'JASON', a document will 
# automatically get downloaded, which contains all the details including the private key.
# In order for Turbot to be able to manage services in the project, admins must enable the Cloud Resource Manager 
# and Service Management APIs.

# Substitute
# ----------
#
# Substitute real values for STEP 1.
#
# <parent>:
#   Any valid Turbot folder ID can be substituted.
#   To get Turbot folder ID, please see the perticular Turbot env where the account is suppose to be imported.
#   One can either select an existing folder under 'Turbot' or create a new folder by clicking on the hamburger menu and
#   selecting 'New child resource'.
#   By selecting the folder, the folder ID can be taken from the 'overview' tab on Turbot env.
#   
# <projectId>:
#   The GCP project ID that needs to be imported.
#   It can be retrieved from the GCP console Home, under project info.

# Use Cases
# ---------
#
#   STEP 1
#   ------
#     1. Get the parent ID form Turbot console.
#     2. Get the projectId form GCP console.
#     3. Excute STEP 1 GraphQL script.
#
#   STEP 2
#   ------
#     1. Get the Turbot ID returned from STEP 1.
#     2. Get Client Email from the GCP console.
#     3. Get private Key from the doc, that was downloaded during the service account creation.
#     4. Excute STEP 2 GraphQL script.
