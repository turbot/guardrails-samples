# Description
# -----------
#
# List all CIS the policy types for a specific cloud provider
#

# Usage
# -----
#
# turbot graphql --query ./list-cis-policy-types-by-cloud-provider.graphql
#

# Filter
# ------
#
# policyType:
#   Used to filter the returned policy types.
#   In example, we have used the policyType filter twice which works as a logical AND.
#   The first policyType is set to `cis`, which will limit the returned subset to any CIS policy.
#   The second policyType is set to `azure`, which will further limit the returned subset to only include policies for Azure Cloud.
#
# sort:
#   Sets the order of the returned query results.
#   In this example, it is set to path which will return the results in hierarchical order.
#

# Use Cases
# ---------
#
#   Azure CIS only
#   ------------
#     Set the second policyType to `azure` to get CIS policy types for Azure.
#
#   GCP CIS only
#   ------------
#     Set the second policyType to `gcp` to get CIS policy types for GCP.
#
#   AWS CIS only
#   ------------
#     Set the second policyType to `aws` to get CIS policy types for AWS.
