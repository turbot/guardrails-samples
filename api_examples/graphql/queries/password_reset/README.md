Find a specific user then set the password

## Prerequisites

To run the scripts, you must have:

- [Turbot CLI](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/7-minute-labs/cli)
- Turbot API Keys for the target environment.

### Turbot configuration

If not done so already, run `turbot configure` to setup proper credentials.

### Setting a password

1. Get the Turbot resource ID of the target user.

```shell script
turbot graphql --profile client-prod --query ./get_users.graphql
```

2. From the user query, find the resource ID of the user.
3. Copy the resource ID into the `user` field in user_password.json
4. Set a good strong password in user_password.json
5. Run the below query to set the password.

```shell script
turbot graphql --profile client-prod --query ./set_new_password.graphql --variables user_password.json
```

6. Login as that user to verify that the password applied properly.
