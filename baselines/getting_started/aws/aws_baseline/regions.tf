# Limiting Turbot Event Handlers to specific regions. Default to us-east-1 only
# More Info: https://turbot.com/v5/docs/guides/regions#discovering-regions

# Limit Available Regions
# "*" allows Turbot to run in all available regions.
# Other wildcarding is allowed e.g. us*, us-east-*
# Remove the comment next to the region to include additional regions to the scope  
# Note: us-east-1 is required since it is an AWS global region for specific services
