variable "resource_active" {
  description = <<DESC
  Map of the list of resources to be active.
  Possible values for the key of this map is found in locals.tf defined in the local variable policy_map.
  For example `azure-compute-virtualMachine` : "tmod:@turbot/azure-compute#/policy/types/virtualMachineActive"
  The value of the map is one of these possible values:
      "Skip"
      "Check: Active"
      "Enforce: Delete inactive with 1 day warning"
      "Enforce: Delete inactive with 3 days warning"
      "Enforce: Delete inactive with 7 days warning"
      "Enforce: Delete inactive with 14 days warning"
      "Enforce: Delete inactive with 30 days warning"
      "Enforce: Delete inactive with 60 days warning"
      "Enforce: Delete inactive with 90 days warning"
      "Enforce: Delete inactive with 180 days warning"
      "Enforce: Delete inactive with 365 days warning"
  Check demo.tfvars for an example of how to set this value.
  NOTE: Default behaviour is to approve all services which means expecting all mods to be installed
