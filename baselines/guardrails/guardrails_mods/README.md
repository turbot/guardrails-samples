# Guardrails Mods Installation

Turbot Guardrails provides a set of mods that enforce best practices, security controls, and compliance frameworks across your cloud environment. This README guides you through the process of installing Guardrails mods using Terraform. The example provided installs the CIS (Center for Internet Security) mod, which is designed to help you achieve and maintain CIS compliance across your resources.

### Install

After initializing Terraform, you can apply the Guardrails mod:

#### 1. Using an Input Variable File (If Applicable)

If you have customized a `default.tfvars` file with specific parameters for the CIS mod or additional mods, you can apply the configuration as follows:

```sh
terraform apply --var-file=default.tfvars -parallelism=1
```

#### 2. Without an Input Variable File

To install the guardrails mods mod without using an input variable file, run:

```sh
terraform apply -parallelism=1
```

### Destroy

You can remove the Guardrails mod in one of two ways:

#### 1. Using an Input Variable File

Run the following command to destroy the Guardrails mod configuration using a specific input variable file:

```sh
terraform destroy --var-file=default.tfvars -parallelism=1
```

#### 2. Without an Input Variable File

Run the following command to destroy the Guardrails mod configuration without using an input variable file:

```sh
terraform destroy -parallelism=1
```
