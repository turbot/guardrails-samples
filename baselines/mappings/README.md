# Mappings

Turbot Control Mappings provide guidance of linking Turbot features to common control frameworks.  Mappings are provided in markdown to collaborate through our TDK.  Turbot has csv/xlsx versions as well. As our mappings grow, we will continue to add policy baselines and reports supporting them.  Please feel free to contribute through the TDK or reach out to connect@turbot.com to collaborate.
