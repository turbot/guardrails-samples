# SOC2 Mapping

There are 33 primary SOC2 controls, while many are satisfied by organizational policies & procedures, 60% are technical controls which require ongoing evidence your organization is in adherence.  Below is a full mapping to SOC2 Controls, COSO Principles, and Turbot Features

Other configurations are ensured through Turbot policies e.g. AWS > RDS > DB Instance > Active > Last Modified, AWS > RDS > DB Instance > Approved > Usage (checking on Status) |
| Monitoring Activities | CC4.2 | COSO Principle 17 | The entity evaluates and communicates internal control deficiencies in a timely manner to those parties responsible for taking corrective action, including senior management and the board of directors, as appropriate. | [Turbot Controls](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/controls) + [Turbot Notifications](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/notifications) | e.g. Turbot controls in check mode provide instant awareness when changes are OK or in ALARM.

Turbot integrates with the company directory to associate time based, role based access controls (RBAC) to specific resources.  Additional controls to expire profiles, access keys, passwords, policy attachments, etc provide over permissive access into critical environments.   e.g. AWS > IAM > Access Key > Active (enforce 90 days expiration); AWS > IAM > Role > Policy Attachments > Approved (ensure no changes to permissions occur); AWS > IAM > User > Approved (ensure user has MFA associated). |
| Logical & Physical Access Controls | CC6.2 |  | Prior to issuing system credentials and granting system access, the entity registers and authorizes new internal and external users whose access is administered by the entity. For those users whose access is administered by the entity, user system credentials are removed when user access is no longer authorized. | [Turbot Permission Management](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/iam/permissions) + [RBAC time based grants](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/integrations/aws/permissions)| e.g. expiration of granted permissions provides protection for time limited access, along with directory integration will sync to block profiles no longer available to access the system |
| Logical & Physical Access Controls | CC6.3 |  | The entity authorizes, modifies, or removes access to data, software, functions, and other protected information assets based on roles, responsibilities, or the system design and changes, giving consideration to the concepts of least privilege and segregation of duties, to meet the entity’s objectives. | [Turbot Permission Management](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/iam/permissions) + [RBAC time based grants](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/integrations/aws/permissions), Turbot IAM [Roles, Users, Groups, Policies] [Approved](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/guardrails/approved) | e.g. activation of granted permissions provides the mechanism to pre-approve on time limited duration, coupled with time limited activation of those permissions provides a process to limit access in time of need and periodic review of permissions granted |
| Logical & Physical Access Controls | CC6.4 |  | The entity restricts physical access to facilities and protected information assets (for example, data center facilities, backup media storage, and other sensitive locations) to authorized personnel to meet the entity’s objectives. | [Inherited Control from Cloud Provider](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/soc-faqs/) | e.g. Physical Security controls are the responsibility of the Cloud Provider; inherited control |
| Logical & Physical Access Controls | CC6.5 |  | The entity discontinues logical and physical protections over physical assets only after the ability to read or recover data and software from those assets has been diminished and is no longer required to meet the entity’s objectives. | [Turbot Active](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/guardrails/active) Controls | e.g. lifecycle policies can be set on data retention of volumes, snapshots, etc.  AWS > EC2 > Snapshots > Active > Age (delete after x days) |
| Logical & Physical Access Controls | CC6.6 |  | The entity implements logical access security measures to protect against threats from sources outside its system boundaries. | [Turbot Lockdown](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/integrations/aws/permissions#lockdown-and-boundary-policies) Policies + [Turbot Trusted Access](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/guardrails/trusted-access) Policies + Turbot Networking Policies | e.g. Turbot Lockdown policies provide preventative controls to block high risk or unapproved actions from occurring e.g. AWS > Turbot > Permissions > Lockdown > Region Boundary (block actions in unapproved regions), AWS > S3 > Permissions > Levels > ACL Administration (set to disable).  Turbot Trusted Access Policies define whom and what you trust and enforce those limitations on your cloud resources e.g. {Provider} > {Service} > {Resource} > Policy > Trusted Access to Accounts, Orgs, Identity Providers, Services, etc.  Additional controls for networking to prevent public routing, firewall rules exposing public ingress; AWS > VPC > Security Group > Ingress Rules > Approved (approve/reject criteria for ports, CIDRs, bitmask, etc.) |
| Logical & Physical Access Controls | CC6.7 |  | The entity restricts the transmission, movement, and removal of information to authorized internal and external users and processes, and protects it during transmission, movement, or removal to meet the entity’s objectives. | [Turbot Encryption at Rest](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/guardrails/encryption-at-rest) and [Encryption in Transit](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/guardrails/encryption-in-transit) Policies | e.g. Turbot encryption policies can be set to ensure encryption in transit or at rest are configured; AWS > S3 > Bucket > Encryption In Transit (set to enable), AWS > S3 > Bucket > Encryption at Rest (set to at least SSE enabled) |

| System Operations | CC7.1 |  | To meet its objectives, the entity uses detection and monitoring procedures to identify (1) changes to configurations that result in the introduction of new vulnerabilities, and (2) susceptibilities to newly discovered vulnerabilities. | [Turbot Reporting](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/guides/console#reports-dashboard) | e.g. Turbot Reporting provides awareness of control alarms status, resource activity changes, etc |
| System Operations | CC7.2 |  | The entity monitors system components and the operation of those components for anomalies that are indicative of malicious acts, natural disasters, and errors affecting the entity's ability to meet its objectives; anomalies are analyzed to determine whether they represent security events. | [Turbot Controls](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/controls) | e.g. controls test/audit for compliance providing an alarm status for whether the policy is being adhered to.  Controls are reported for review, or Turbot is set to enforce immediately to close any known incidents |
| System Operations | CC7.3 |  | The entity evaluates security events to determine whether they could or have resulted in a failure of the entity to meet its objectives (security incidents) and, if so, takes actions to prevent or address such failures. | [Turbot Policy](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/policies) + [Turbot Controls](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/controls) | e.g. periodic review of control health and activities provides feedback for ongoing improvement on policy settings |
