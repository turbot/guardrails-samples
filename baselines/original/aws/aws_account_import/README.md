# AWS Account Import Baseline

The AWS account import baseline terraform configuration lets you import an AWS Account into turbot with the necessary roles and permissions.

  - It is recommended that you import accounts into Turbot Folders, as it provides greater flexibility and ease of management.
  - Give the role a purposeful name such as `turbot-readonly` (read only) or `turbot-superuser` (for full access).
  - By default, Turbot is installed with administrator access to enable full functionality. However, You may change this if required.
