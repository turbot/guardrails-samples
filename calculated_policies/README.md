## Calculated Policies

Provides templates for implementing calculated policies. 

Calculated policies allow Turbot administrators to modify or extend the default behavior and logic that Turbot uses to evaluate controls.

The calculated policy examples are implemented with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) allowing you to manage and 
provision Turbot with a repeatable, idempotent, versioned infrastructure-as-code approach.

### TDK examples

**Example**: [aws_ec2_instance_age](./aws_ec2_instance_age/README.md)

**Details**
This script provides a Terraform configuration for creating a smart folder and applying a calculated policy on the 
`AWS > EC2 > Instance > Active > Age` policy.  
The Calculated policy sets the active age threshold to 30 days when a tag is present on the instance matching 
{Environment:=Lab} and to skip if it is not present or set to an alternate value.

---

**Example**: [aws_ec2_instance_approved_usage_approved_account_ami](./aws_ec2_instance_approved_usage_approved_account_ami/README.md)

**Details**
Calculated policy for policy `AWS > EC2 > Instance > Approved > Usage`.
If a EC2 Instance Image is not owned by an account in the approved accounts list, then the approved usage
policy will be set to `Not approved` otherwise it will be set to `Approved`.

---

**Example**: [aws_ec2_instance_approved_usage_local_ami](./aws_ec2_instance_approved_usage_local_ami/README.md)

**Details**
Calculated policy for policy `AWS > EC2 > Instance > Approved > Usage`.
Approval policy that will limit running EC2 Instances to only use local EC2 Instance Images.
If an EC2 Instance Image is not owned by the account that the Instance is running on, then the approved usage
policy will be set to `Not approved` otherwise it will be set to `Approved`.

---

**Example**: [aws_ec2_instance_approved_usage_trusted_ami](./aws_ec2_instance_approved_usage_trusted_ami/README.md)

**Details**
Calculated policy for policy `AWS > EC2 > Instance > Approved > Usage`.
If a EC2 Instance Image is not in the trusted AMI list, then the approved usage
policy will be set to `Not approved` otherwise it will be set to `Approved`.

---

**Example**: [aws_ec2_public_subnet](./aws_ec2_public_subnet/README.md)

**Details**
This script provides a Terraform configuration for creating a smart folder and applying a calculated policy using 
`AWS > EC2 > Instance > Approved > Usage` policy and then setting `AWS > EC2 > Instance > Approved` to check.

---

**Example**: [aws_guardduty_detector_approved_usage](./aws_guardduty_detector_approved_usage/README.md)

**Details**
Calculated policy for policy `AWS > GuardDuty > Detector > Approved > Usage`.
If a Detector is the master or member of a given master account then the approved usage policy will be set
to `Approved` otherwise it will be set to `Not approved`.

---

**Example**: [aws_lambda_in_vpc](./aws_lambda_in_vpc/README.md)

**Details**
This script provides a Terraform configuration for creating a smart folder and applying a calculated policy on the 
`AWS > Lambda > Function > Approved > Usage` policy.  
The Calculated policy checks the Lambda metadata for existence of the attribute VpcConfig and can be expanded to check
for a specific VPC Id or Subnet Ids.

---

**Example**: [aws_lambda_not_approved_cross_account_access](./aws_lambda_not_approved_cross_account_access/README.md)

**Details**
Calculated policy for policy `AWS > Lambda > Function > Approved > Usage`.
If a function policy has cross-account access then the approved usage policy will be set to `Not approved` otherwise
it will be set to `Approved`.

---

**Example**: [aws_rds_db_cluster_snapshot_cross_account_access](./aws_rds_db_cluster_snapshot_cross_account_access/README.md)

**Details**
Use the AWS > RDS > DB Cluster Snapshot [Manual] > Approved > Usage policy.
Calculated policy for policy `AWS > RDS > DB Cluster Snapshot [Manual] > Approved > Usage` policy.
If the account that the snapshot is shared with, given by the property `DBClusterSnapshotAttributes.AttributeValues`

---

**Example**: [aws_redshift_restrict_cross_account_snapshot_access](./aws_redshift_restrict_cross_account_snapshot_access/README.md)

**Details**
Calculated policy for policy `AWS > Redshift > Manual Cluster Snapshot > Approved > Usage`.
If a manual snapshot is configured to allow access from external accounts restore access then the approved usage 
policy will be set to `Not approved` otherwise it will be set to `Approved`.

---

**Example**: [aws_s3_approved_static_website_hosting_requires_cloud_front](./aws_s3_approved_static_website_hosting_requires_cloud_front/README.md)

**Details**
Provides a Terraform configuration for creating a smart folder and applying a calculated policy on the 
`AWS> S3> Bucket> Tags> Template`.
The Calculated policy creates a tag template.
The template shows creating static and dynamic values.
It also shows how to control the values of tags on a bucket.

---

**Example**: [aws_s3_bucket_approved_usage_name_dns_compliant](./aws_s3_bucket_approved_usage_name_dns_compliant/README.md)

**Details**
Calculated policy for policy `AWS > S3 > Bucket > Approved > Usage`.
If a S3 Bucket name is not DNS compliant, then the approved usage policy will be set to `Not approved` otherwise
it will be set to `Approved`.

---

**Example**: [aws_s3_bucket_tagging_template](./aws_s3_bucket_tagging_template/README.md)

**Details**
Provides a Terraform configuration for creating a smart folder and applying a calculated policy on the 
`AWS> S3> Bucket> Tags> Template`.
The Calculated policy creates a tag template.
The template shows creating static and dynamic values.
It also shows how to control the values of tags on a bucket.

---

**Example**: [aws_sqs_approved](./aws_sqs_approved/README.md)

**Details**
Provides a Terraform configuration for creating a smart folder and applying a calculated policy on the 
`AWS > SQS > Queue > Approved > Usage` policy.
The Calculated policy creates a template that will alarm if a queue policy contains "Action: SQS:*".

---

**Example**: [azure_load_balancer_prohibited_ports](./azure_load_balancer_prohibited_ports/README.md)

**Details**
This Terraform configuration for creating a smart folder and applying the 
`Azure > Load Balancer > Load Balancer > Approved` to "Check: Approved" and a calculated policy on 
`Azure > Load Balancer > Load Balancer > Approved > Usage`.
The Calculated policy sets the value to "Unapproved" when one of the specified ports are present in the NAT or Load 
Balancer front end or back end rules and sets the value "Approved" otherwise.

---

**Example**: [multi_cloud_storage_cost_savings](./multi_cloud_storage_cost_savings/README.md)

**Details**
This Terraform template creates a smart folder and applies a calculated policies on the policies:

- `Azure > Storage > Storage Account > Access Tier`
- `AWS > S3 > Bucket > Versioning`

For Azure, the calculated policy sets the storage tier to "Cool" when an Azure label matching {Environment:=Dev} is 
present on a storage account resource

For AWS, the calculated policy disables S3 versioning when an AWS tag matching {Environment:=Dev} is present on an 
S3 bucket resource.
