# This is a policy type definition file
#
# Automated controls require a large number of configuration settings from the biggest decisions (e.g. allowed services)
# right down to small, but critical, details (e.g. automated tags for cost management).
# In Turbot, Policies are used to manage these settings.
# Please refer to https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/policies for details

# Here we are defining the `Dunder Mifflin > AWS > CloudTrail > AWS.CloudTrail.001 - Enable Cloudtrail in All Regions` policy type
awsCloudTrail001:

  # The policy's title as it will be shown on Turbot UI console
  title: AWS.CloudTrail.001 - Enable Cloudtrail in All Regions

  # Here we pick a good icon to represent what the policy is about. Usually the same icon as the respective control
  # It helps quickly identifying the policy on Turbot UI console
  icon: fal-shield-check

  # Policy type will be placed under: `Dunder Mifflin > AWS > CloudTrail`
  parent: "#/policy/types/dmiccfAwsCloudTrail"

  # Policy will be under category hierarchy level: `Dunder Mifflin > Logging & Auditing`
  category: "dmi-ccf#/control/categories/dmiccfAud"

  # This policy refers to resource types listed bellow
  targets:
    - "tmod:@turbot/aws#/resource/types/account"

  # A short explanation of what the control related to this policy does. Usually the same as in Control definition
  # Text here will be shown on Turbot UI console
  description: |
    Check if there is at least one multi regional trail

  # Here we define the expected data type for the Policy entry
  # For that we will be using JSON Schema (http://json-schema.org)
  schema:
    type: string
    enum:
      - Skip
      - Check
      - Per Dunder Mifflin > AWS
    # `Per Dunder Mifflin > AWS` means whatever is set on `Dunder Mifflin > AWS` policy, the mod's top level policy
    default: Per Dunder Mifflin > AWS
