# This is a control type definition file
#
# Controls are responsible for enforcing one or more policies
# While Policies define the desired settings for Resources, Controls are responsible for implementing them
# Please refer to https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/controls#control-types for details

# Here we are defining the `Dunder Mifflin > AWS > S3 > AWS.S3.001 - Set Default Encryption on S3 Buckets` control type
awsS3001:

  # The control's title as it will be shown on Turbot UI console
  title: AWS.S3.001 - Set Default Encryption on S3 Buckets

  # Here we pick a good icon to represent control's action. Usually the same icon as the respective policy
  # It helps quickly identifying the control on Turbot UI console
  icon: fal-shield-check

  # Control type will be placed under: `Dunder Mifflin > AWS > S3`
  parent: "#/control/types/dmiccfAwsS3"

  # Control will be under category hierarchy level: `Dunder Mifflin > S3 Security & Encryption`
  category: "dmi-ccf#/control/categories/dmiccfData"

  # Control will run against the resource types listed bellow
  targets:
    - "tmod:@turbot/aws-s3#/resource/types/bucket"

  # A short explanation of what this control does. Text here will be shown on Turbot UI console
  description: |
    Check if bucket default encryption is set

  # Input block is where it's defined which data the control will use
  # For that, Turbot offers a query engine based on GraphQL
  # For filtering features, please check out https://turbot.com/v5/docs/reference/filter
