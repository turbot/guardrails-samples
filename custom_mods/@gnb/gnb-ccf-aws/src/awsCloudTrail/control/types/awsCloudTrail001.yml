# This is a control type definition file
#
# Controls are responsible for enforcing one or more policies
# While Policies define the desired settings for Resources, Controls are responsible for implementing them
# Please refer to https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/controls#control-types for details

# Here we are defining the `Goliath > AWS > CloudTrail > AWS.CloudTrail.001 - Enable Cloudtrail in All Regions` control type
awsCloudTrail001:

  # The control's title as it will be shown on Turbot UI console
  title: AWS.CloudTrail.001 - Enable Cloudtrail in All Regions

  # Here we pick a good icon to represent control's action. Usually the same icon as the respective policy
  # It helps quickly identifying the control on Turbot UI console
  icon: fal-shield-check

  # Control type will be placed under: `Goliath > AWS > CloudTrail`
  parent: "#/control/types/gnbccfAwsCloudTrail"

  # Control will be under category hierarchy level: `Goliath > Logging & Auditing`
  category: "gnb-ccf#/control/categories/gnbccfAud"

  # Control will run against the resource types listed bellow
  targets:
    - "tmod:@turbot/aws#/resource/types/account"

  # A short explanation of what this control does. Text here will be shown on Turbot UI console
  description: |
    Check if there is at least one multi regional trail

  # Input block is where it's defined which data the control will use
  # For that, Turbot offers a query engine based on GraphQL
  # For filtering features, please check out https://turbot.com/v5/docs/reference/filter
  input:

    # For this control, we will need to search for any trail which is multi-regional. However, we want to check only
    # trails belonging to the AWS account where the control is running
    #
    # To achieve that, first, control needs to get the AWS account id
    # Query bellow gets the `Id` property of the `account` resource. (resource are defined at targets block)

        #     previous query
        #   - $.IsMultiRegionTrail:'true' -> Only multi-regional trails
        # Only the total of found trails is fine for this control, so, we get metadata.stats.total of the result
