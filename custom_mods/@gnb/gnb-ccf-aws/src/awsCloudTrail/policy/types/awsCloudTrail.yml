# This file contains policy type definitions

# Here we are defining the `Goliath > AWS > CloudTrail` policy type
gnbccfAwsCloudTrail:

  # The policy's title as it will be shown on Turbot UI console
  title: CloudTrail

  # Here we pick a good icon to represent what the policy is about. Usually the same icon as the respective control
  # It helps quickly identifying the policy on Turbot UI console
  icon: fal-shield-check

  # Policy type will be placed under: `Goliath > AWS`
  parent: "#/policy/types/gnbccfAws"

  # Policy will be under category hierarchy level: `Goliath > Logging & Auditing`
  category: "gnb-ccf#/control/categories/gnbccfAud"
