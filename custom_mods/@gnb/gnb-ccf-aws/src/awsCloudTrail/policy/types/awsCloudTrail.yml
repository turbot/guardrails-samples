# Here we are defining the `Dunder Mifflin > AWS > CloudTrail` policy type
dmiccfAwsCloudTrail:

  # The policy's title as it will be shown on Turbot UI console
  title: CloudTrail

  # Here we pick a good icon to represent what the policy is about. Usually the same icon as the respective control
  # It helps quickly identifying the policy on Turbot UI console
  icon: fal-shield-check

  # Policy type will be placed under: `Dunder Mifflin > AWS`
  parent: "#/policy/types/dmiccfAws"

  # Policy will be under category hierarchy level: `Dunder Mifflin > Logging & Auditing`
