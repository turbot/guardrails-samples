# This file contains control type definitions
# Controls defined here are not intended to execute any action but to build a hierarchy of control types
#
# Please refer to https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/controls#control-types for details

# Here we are defining the `Goliath > AWS > IAM` control type
gnbccfAwsIam:
  # The control's title as it will be shown on Turbot UI console
  title: IAM

  # Here we pick a good icon to represent control's action. Usually the same icon as the respective policy
  # It helps quickly identifying the control on Turbot UI console
  icon: fal-shield-check

  # Control type will be placed under: `Goliath > AWS`
  parent: "#/control/types/gnbccfAws"

  # Control will be under category hierarchy level: `Goliath > Authentication & Access Control`
  category: "gnb-ccf#/control/categories/gnbccfAac"
