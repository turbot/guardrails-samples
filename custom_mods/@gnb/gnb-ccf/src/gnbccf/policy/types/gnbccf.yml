# This is a policy type definition
#
# Automated controls require a large number of configuration settings from the biggest decisions (e.g. allowed services)
# right down to small, but critical, details (e.g. automated tags for cost management).
# In Turbot, Policies are used to manage these settings.
# Please refer to https://turbot.com/v5/docs/concepts/policies for details

# Here we are defining the top level policy type of this mod
dmiccf:

  # The policy's title as it will be shown on Turbot UI console
  title: Dunder Mifflin

  # Here we pick a good icon to represent what the policy is about. Usually the same icon as the respective control
  # It helps quickly identifying the policy on Turbot UI console
  icon: fal-shield-check

  # A short explanation of what the policy refers to
