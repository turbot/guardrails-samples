# Run policies in batches

Finds all controls matching the provided filter, then re-runs them in batches if `--execute` is set.
After each batch the script will then enter cool down mode which will wait a number of seconds before running the 
next batch of policies.

For further reference see [filtering policy values](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/reference/filter/policies#filtering-policy-values).

## Prerequisites

To run the scripts, you must have:

- [Python 3.\*.\*](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

## Setup

This sections details how to set up an environment in order to run the script.

### Virtual environments activation

We recommend the use of [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

To setup a virtual environment:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Once created, to activate the environment:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Dependencies

Then install Python library dependencies:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Turbot configuration

Credentials and end point details need to be configure before being able to connect to a Turbot installation.
This configuration can be entered either using environment variables or a configuration file.

#### Environment variables

Use either configuration for your Turbot installation:

```shell
export TURBOT_WORKSPACE="https://<environment-name>.cloud.turbot.com/"
export TURBOT_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ac61d2e4-730c-4b54-8c3c-6ef172390814
export TURBOT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=151b296b-0694-4a28-94c4-4b67fa82ab2c
```

or

```shell
export TURBOT_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT="https://<environment-name>.cloud.turbot.com/api/latest/graphql"
export TURBOT_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ac61d2e4-730c-4b54-8c3c-6ef180150814
export TURBOT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=151b296b-0694-4a28-94c4-4767fa82bb2c
```

#### Configuration file

Example configuration file:

```yaml
default:
  accessKey: dc61d2e4-730c-4b54-8c3c-6ef180150814
  secretKey: 6ef18015-7d0c-2b51-4d2c-dc61d2e63a22
  workspace: "https://demo-acme.cloud.turbot.com/"
```

This script will automatically search for a `credentials.yml` file in `~/.config/turbot/` or you can save the yaml configuration file anywhere and provide the `--config /path/to/config.yml --profile default` as a command line option.

## Executing the script

To run a the Python script:

1. Install and configure the [pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)
1. Using the command line, navigate to the directory for the Python script
1. Create and activate the Python virtual environment
1. Install dependencies
1. Run the Python script using the command line
1. Deactivate the Python virtual environment

### Synopsis

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py [options]
```

### Options

#### Details

-c, --config-file

> [String] Pass an optional yaml config file.

-p, --profile

> [String] Profile to be used from config file.

-f, --filter

> Used to filter out matching policies.

-b, --batch

> [Int] The number of policies to run before cooldown per cycle

-s, --start-index

> [Int] Sets the starting point in the returned control collection. All policies starting at the starting point will be run.

-d, --cooldown

> [Int] Number of seconds to pause before the next batch of policies are run. Setting this value to `0` will disable cooldown.

-m, --max-batch

> [Int] The maximum number of batches to run. The value `-1` will run all the returned policies from the starting point.

-e, --execute

> Will re-run policies when found.

--help

> Lists all the options and their usages.

#### Example usage

##### Example 1

The return the number of policies found that will be run by the script without re-running the control.

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py 
```

##### Example 2

Re-runs all the policies found.

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py --execute
```

##### Example 3

Re-run policies in TBD state - default behavior.

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py -f "state:tbd"
```

##### Example 4

Re-run policies in error state.

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py -f "state:error"
```

##### Example 5

Re-run policies in multiple states.

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py -f "state:tbd,error,alarm"
```

##### Example 6

Re-run all policies in categorized as CMDB polices.

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py -f "controlCategoryId:'tmod:@turbot/turbot#/control/categories/cmdb'"
```

##### Example 7

Re-run policies that match a specific policy type.

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py -f "policyTypeId:'tmod:@turbot/azure-activedirectory#/policy/types/directoryCmdb'"
```

##### Example 8

Re-run policies in batches of 200.

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py -b 200
```

##### Example 9

Re-run policies with no cool down.

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py -d 0
```

##### Example 10

Run the script using credentials given in a credential file `credentials.yml`.

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py -c .config/turbot/credentials.yml
```

##### Example 11

Run the script using a credentials file and using the credential details using the profile `env`.

```shell
python3 run_policies_batches.py -c .config/turbot/credentials.yml -p env --notification_class resource
```

## Virtual environments deactivation

Once the script has been run, it is advised to deactivate the virtual environment if a virtual environment was used
to install the script dependencies.

This is accomplished by running the command:

```shell
deactivate
```
