# Configure VPC Flow Logs

This policy pack provides a Terraform configuration for checking and enabling Flow Logs in a VPC.

## Installation

Installing this Policy Pack requires [admin credentials to a Turbot Guardrails workspace](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/iam/access-keys) and [a way to run Terraform](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/7-minute-labs/terraform).

Clone the repo locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples.git
cd guardrails-samples/policy_packs/aws/aws_vpc_flow_logs
```

## How to use

1. **Set the variable values**:

    ```sh
    cp default.tfvars.example default.tfvars
    vi default.tfvars
    ```

    ```hcl
    # Log Metric Filter name for control 4.1
    policy_pack_title = "Policy Pack for VPC Flow Logs"
    ```

1. **Create the Policy Pack in your workspace**:

    ```sh
    terraform init
    export TURBOT_PROFILE="my-workspace"
    terraform plan 
    terraform apply
    ```

1. **Attach the Policy Pack to your test account**: Within the Guardrails UI navigate to [{workspace-url}/apollo?exploreMode=account](#). Select the account from the list for testing. Click on the "Detail" sub-tab and look for the "Policy Packs" widget in the bottom right of the page. Select the "MANAGE" link and `+ Add` the `Configure VPC Flow Logs` Policy Pack from the dropdown menu, then select "Save".
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Do not add or remove more than one Policy Pack to a resource at a time. Adding Policy Packs is an asynchronous operation, after changing the Policy Pack configuration for a resource, wait at least 5 minutes before adding or removing other Policy Packs.

1. **Verify state (`OK`, `Alarm`, `Error`) of associated controls**: Within the Guardrails UI navigate to:

    ```sh
    {workspace-url}/apollo/controls/explore?filter=controlTypeId%3A%27tmod%3A%40turbot%2Faws-vpc-core%23%2Fcontrol%2Ftypes%2FvpcFlowloggingStack%27
    ```

    Replace `{workspace-url}` with the FQDN of your workspace (e.g. <https://company.cloud.turbot.com>). Use the "Resource" filter to select the test account where the Policy Pack is attached. Review all controls in `Alarm` state to understand why they are violating this policy pack objective.

1. For each control type, choose to [resolve the alarms](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/quick-actions), [create resource exceptions](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/getting-started/activity-exceptions#manual-policy-exceptions) or to apply enforcement settings. The default setting for all controls are set to `Check: ...`. Each policy with an enforcement option will have a corresponding enforcement setting that is commented out. These can easily be found by searching across the `*.tf` files for `Enforce:`.

1. To apply enforcement automation: Open the Policy Pack Terraform source files in your code editor. Toggle individual controls between `Check` and `Enforce` by changing which line is commented out:

    ```hcl
    resource "turbot_policy_setting" "vpc_flow_logs" {
        resource = turbot_smart_folder.vpc_flow_logging.id
        type = "tmod:@turbot/aws-vpc-core#/policy/types/vpcFlowLogging"
        # value = "Check: Configured per `Flow Logging > *`"
        value = "Enforce: Configured per `Flow Logging > *`"
    }
    ```

    Then re-apply the Terraform stack:

    ```sh
    terraform plan 
    terrafrom apply
    ```

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Enforcement controls have the ability delete data, remove permissions and change configuration of your cloud resources. Guardrails automation is very fast and there is no undo; if you do not fully understand the scope of an enforcement or the potential impact to your applications then do not implement enforcement options.
