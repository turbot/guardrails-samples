# Enforce Backups of EBS Volumes

Enforcing backups of EBS volumes provides a crucial defense against lost data. Guardrails uses the AWS Backup service to create and manage backups of EBS volumes. 

This [policy pack](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/concepts/policy-packs) can help you configure the following settings for AWS Backup: 
- Create the required IAM role for AWS Backup to use.
- Create Backup vaults, plans, and selections to backup EBS volumes.

**[Review policy settings â†’](https://hub.guardrails.turbot.com/policy-packs/aws_backup_enforce_ebs_volume_backups/settings)**

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)
- The following Guardrails mods need to be installed:
  - [@turbot/aws](https://hub.guardrails.turbot.com/mods/aws/mods/aws)
  - [@turbot/aws-backup](https://hub.guardrails.turbot.com/mods/aws/mods/aws-backup)
  - [@turbot/aws-iam](https://hub.guardrails.turbot.com/mods/aws/mods/aws-iam)

### Credentials

To create a policy pack through Terraform:

- Ensure you have `Turbot/Admin` permissions (or higher) in Guardrails
- [Create access keys](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/iam/access-keys#generate-a-new-guardrails-api-access-key) in Guardrails

And then set your credentials:

```sh
export TURBOT_WORKSPACE=myworkspace.acme.com
export TURBOT_ACCESS_KEY=acce6ac5-access-key-here
export TURBOT_SECRET_KEY=a8af61ec-secret-key-here
```

Please see [Turbot Guardrails Provider authentication](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/turbot/turbot/latest/docs#authentication) for additional authentication methods.

## Usage

### Install Policy Pack

> [!NOTE]
> By default, installed policy packs are not attached to any resources.
>
> Policy packs must be attached to resources in order for their policy settings to take effect.

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples.git
cd guardrails-samples/policy_packs/aws/backup/enforce_ebs_volume_backups
```

Run the Terraform to create the policy pack in your workspace:

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
```

Then apply the changes:

```sh
terraform apply
```

### Apply Policy Pack

Log into your Guardrails workspace and [attach the policy pack to a resource](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/policy-packs#attach-a-policy-pack-to-a-resource).

If this policy pack is attached to a Guardrails folder, its policies will be applied to all accounts and resources in that folder. The policy pack can also be attached to multiple resources.

For more information, please see [Policy Packs](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/concepts/policy-packs).

### Enable Enforcement

> [!TIP]
> You can also update the policy settings in this policy pack directly in the Guardrails console.
>
> Please note your Terraform state file will then become out of sync and the policy settings should then only be managed in the console.

By default, the policies are set to `Check` in the pack's policy settings. To enable automated enforcements, you can switch these policies settings by adding a comment to the `Check` setting and removing the comment from one of the listed enforcement options:

```hcl
# AWS > Backup > Stack
resource "turbot_policy_setting" "aws_backup_stack" {
  resource = turbot_policy_pack.main.id
  type     = "tmod:@turbot/aws-backup#/policy/types/backupStack"
  #value    = "Check: Configured"
  value    = "Enforce: Configured"
}

# AWS > IAM > Stack > Source
resource "turbot_policy_setting" "aws_iam_iam_stack" {
  resource = turbot_policy_pack.main.id
  type     = "tmod:@turbot/aws-iam#/policy/types/iamStack"
  # value    = "Check: Configured"
  value    = "Enforce: Configured"
}
```

Then re-apply the changes:

```sh
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Disable Backups

To stop backups from happening while preserving the existing backups, remove this resource definition from the `AWS > Backup > Stack > Source` policy setting:

```hcl
    resource "aws_backup_selection" "ebs_resource_assignment" {
      iam_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::{{ $.account.id }}:role/turbot/core/guardrails_backup_service_role"
      name         = "guardrails-ebs-resource-assignment"
      plan_id      = aws_backup_plan.guardrails_ebs_backups.id
      resources = ["arn:aws:ec2:*:*:volume/*"]
    }
```

Then apply the changes:

```sh
terraform plan
terraform apply
````

## Decommission the Backup Vault

To completely remove a Backup Vault and all backups, execute the following steps.

### Delete EBS Volume Backups

Edit the `Backup > Stack > Source` policy setting in the policy pack.
  - To flush the current backups, set the retention period to one day, as shown below. 
  - Remove the Backup Selection from the `AWS > Backup > Stack > Source`.  This will prevent new backups from happening.

When the changes are complete the `template` attribute for `Backup > Stack > Source` should look like this:
 
```hcl
    |
    resource "aws_backup_vault" "vault" {
      name = "guardrails-backup-vault"
      tags = {
        turbot_version = "v5"
      }
    }
    resource "aws_backup_plan" "guardrails_ebs_backups" {
      name = "guardrails-backup-plan"
      rule {
        # The time allowed for the job to start, any longer and it will be cancelled.
        start_window = 480
        # The amount of time allowed for the backup to complete, before it is cancelled.
        completion_window = 10080
        #
        rule_name         = "guardrails-ebs-backups-rule"
        schedule          = "cron(0 5 ? * * *)"
        target_vault_name = aws_backup_vault.vault.name
        lifecycle {
          delete_after = 1
        }
      }
    }
```

Then apply the changes:

```sh
terraform plan
terraform apply
````

### Delete Backup Vault

Wait a day or two for the backups to be flushed from the Guardrails Backup vault. AWS will not allow a vault to be destroyed when backups are still present.

This is most easily done by replacing `template` and `template_input` attributes of `Backup > Stack > Source` as shown below. The `[]` value instructs the `Backup > Stack` control to destroy all managed resources.

```hcl
# AWS > Backup > Stack > Source
resource "turbot_policy_setting" "aws_backup_stack_source" {
  resource = turbot_policy_pack.main.id
  type     = "tmod:@turbot/aws-backup#/policy/types/backupStackSource"
  value    = "[]"  
}
```

Then apply the changes:

```sh
terraform plan
terraform apply
````

Verify that all the `Backup > Stack` controls have gone into an `ok` state.  If they go into `error`, the `Backup > Stack` control logs should give a good indication of what's wrong.

### Delete Backup IAM Role

Edit the `AWS > IAM > Stack > Source` policy to the following:

```hcl
# AWS > IAM > Stack > Source
resource "turbot_policy_setting" "aws_iam_iam_stack_source" {
  resource = turbot_policy_pack.main.id
  type     = "tmod:@turbot/aws-iam#/policy/types/iamStackSource"
  value    = "[]"
}
```

Then apply the changes:

```sh
terraform plan
terraform apply
````
 
Verify that all the `IAM > Stack` controls are in `ok`.  Resolve any controls in an `error` state.

Finally, remove the policy pack from your Guardrails workspace:

```sh
terraform destroy
```
