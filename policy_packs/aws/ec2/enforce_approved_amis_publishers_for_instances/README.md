# Enforce AWS EC2 Instances to Use Approved AMIs and/or Publisher Accounts

Enforcing AWS EC2 instances to use approved AMIs and/or publisher accounts is vital for maintaining a secure and standardized environment. This practice ensures that only trusted, validated images are used, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with organizational policies and security standards.

## Documentation

- **[Policy settings →](https://hub-guardrails-turbot-com-git-development-turbot.vercel.app/policy-packs/enforce_approved_amis_publishers_for_instances/settings)**

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
- The following Guardrails mods need to be installed:
  - [@turbot/aws-ec2](https://hub-guardrails-turbot-com-git-development-turbot.vercel.app/aws/mods/aws-ec2)

### Credentials

To create a policy pack through Terraform:

- Ensure you have `Turbot/Owner` or `Turbot/Admin` permissions in Guardrails
- Create [Guardrails access keys](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/iam/access-keys#generate-a-new-guardrails-api-access-key)

And then set your credentials:

```sh
export TURBOT_WORKSPACE=myworkspace-turbot.cloud.turbot.com
export TURBOT_ACCESS_KEY=acce6ac5-access-key-here
export TURBOT_SECRET_KEY=a8af61ec-secret-key-here
```

Please check [Turbot Guardrails Provider authentication](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/turbot/turbot/latest/docs#authentication) for additional authentication methods.

## Usage

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples.git
cd guardrails-samples/policy_packs/aws/ec2/enforce_approved_amis_publishers_for_instances
```

Run the Terraform to create the policy pack in your workspace:

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
```

Then apply the changes:

```sh
terraform apply
```

Log into your Guardrails workspace and [attach the policy pack to a resource](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/working-with-folders/smart#attach-a-smart-folder-to-a-resource).

### Enable Enforcement

By default, the controls are set to `Check` in the pack's policy settings. To enable automated enforcements, you can switch these policies settings by adding a comment to the `Check` setting and removing the comment from one of the listed enforcement options:

```hcl
resource "turbot_policy_setting" "aws_ec2_instance_approved" {
  resource = turbot_smart_folder.main.id
  type     = "tmod:@turbot/aws-ec2#/policy/types/instanceApproved"
  # value    = "Check: Approved"
  value    = "Enforce: Stop unapproved"
  # value    = "Enforce: Stop unapproved if new"
  # value    = "Enforce: Delete unapproved if new"
}
```

Then re-apply the changes:

```sh
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

You can also update the policy setting on the policy pack directly in the Guardrails console.

Note: If modifying the policy setting in the console, your Terraform state file will become out of sync, so the policy settings should only be managed in the console.
