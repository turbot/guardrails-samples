# Enforce IMDSv2 on AWS EC2 Instances

Enforcing IMDSv2 on AWS EC2 instances enhances security by requiring session-based authentication to access instance metadata, mitigating the risk of unauthorized metadata exposure through vulnerabilities like SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery). This helps ensure that only authorized applications and users can retrieve sensitive instance data.

## Documentation

- **[Policy settings â†’](/policy-packs/enforce_imdsv2_for_instances/settings)**

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)
- The following Guardrails mods need to be installed:
  - `@turbot/aws`
  - `@turbot/aws-iam`
  - `@turbot/aws-ec2`

### Credentials

`Turbot/Admin` permissions are required to create the policy pack and policy settings.

By default, the [Turbot Guardrails default profile](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/reference/cli/installation#set-up-your-turbot-guardrails-credentials) from the Turbot Guardrails CLI will be used. This profile uses [access keys](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/iam/access-keys#generate-a-new-guardrails-api-access-key).

To use a different profile:

```sh
export TURBOT_PROFILE="my-workspace"
```

## Usage

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples.git
cd guardrails-samples/policy_packs/aws/ec2/enforce_imdsv2_for_instances
```

Run the Terraform to create the policy pack in your workspace:

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
```

Then apply the changes:

```sh
terraform apply
```

Log into your Guardrails workspace and [attach the policy pack to a resource](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/working-with-folders/smart#attach-a-smart-folder-to-a-resource).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not add or remove more than one policy pack to a resource at a time. Adding policy packs is an asynchronous operation, after changing the policy pack configuration for a resource, wait at least 5 minutes before adding or removing other policy packs.
