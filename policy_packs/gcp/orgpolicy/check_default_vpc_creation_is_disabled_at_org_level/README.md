# Check If Creation of Default VPC Network Is Disabled at the GCP Organization Level

Checking if the creation of the default VPC network is disabled at the GCP organization level is important for enforcing a secure and customized network architecture. This practice ensures that all projects within the organization use purpose-built VPC networks with specific configurations and security controls, reducing the risk of misconfigurations and enhancing overall network security and compliance with best practices.

This policy pack can help you configure the following settings for org policies:

- Checks if the project org policy `Skip default network creation` the creation of default network is set to `On`

**[Review policy settings â†’](https://hub-guardrails-turbot-com-git-development-turbot.vercel.app/policy-packs/check_default_vpc_creation_is_disabled_at_org_level/settings)**

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started/install-cli)
- Guardrails mods:
  - [@turbot/gcp-orgpolicy](https://hub-guardrails-turbot-com-git-development-turbot.vercel.app/gcp/mods/gcp-orgpolicy)

### Credentials

To create a policy pack through Terraform:

- Ensure you have `Turbot/Admin` permissions (or higher) in Guardrails
- [Create access keys](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/iam/access-keys#generate-a-new-guardrails-api-access-key) in Guardrails

And then set your credentials:

```sh
export TURBOT_WORKSPACE=myworkspace.acme.com
export TURBOT_ACCESS_KEY=acce6ac5-access-key-here
export TURBOT_SECRET_KEY=a8af61ec-secret-key-here
```

Please see [Turbot Guardrails Provider authentication](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/turbot/turbot/latest/docs#authentication) for additional authentication methods.

## Usage

### Install Policy Pack

> [!NOTE]
> By default, installed policy packs are not attached to any resources.
>
> Policy packs must be attached to resources in order for their policy settings to take effect.

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples.git
cd guardrails-samples/policy_packs/gcp/orgpolicy/check_default_vpc_creation_is_disabled_at_org_level
```

Run the Terraform to create the policy pack in your workspace:

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
```

Then apply the changes:

```sh
terraform apply
```

### Apply Policy Pack

Log into your Guardrails workspace and [attach the policy pack to a resource](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/working-with-folders/smart#attach-a-smart-folder-to-a-resource).
