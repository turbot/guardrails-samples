# FAQs and checklist for Policy Packs

## General

Q. `Policy Pack` or `Policy-Pack` or `Policy Pack` or `policy-pack` or `Policy Pack`?
Nathan - it's a type / pronoun similar to "Smart Folder" or "Resource Type", etc ... so it's "Policy Pack".

## Directory structure

Q. What does the directory structure look like?

├── policy_packs
│   ├── aws_account_import
│   ├── aws_audit_logging
│   ├── aws_baseline
│   ├── aws_check_cost_controls
│   ├── aws_check_encryption
│   ├── aws_check_iam
│   ├── aws_check_logging
│   ├── aws_check_public_access
│   ├── aws_check_regions
│   ├── aws_check_s3
│   ├── azure_check_encryption
│   ├── azure_check_logging
│   ├── azure_check_public_access
│   ├── gcp_check_encryption
│   ├── gcp_check_iam
│   ├── gcp_check_labeling
│   ├── gcp_check_logging
│   ├── turbot_iam_roles
│   ├── turbot_logging_buckets
│   └── turbot_profiles

Q. How are the directories named?
A. Directories for Policy Packs are named as per the problem they solve. Should be of the format `<provider>_<service>_<problem_it_solves>`. E.g. `aws_vpc_flow_logs_s3_bucket`.

Q. How are the files named?

Q. How do we decide how many files should we have under a directory? (E.g. For CIS enforcements, do we have 1 file for related policies which makes 5 controls green, or do we separate them out in 5 different files?)

Q. What are the standard files under a Policy Pack directory?
A. Each Policy Pack definition will contain a main.tf, common.tf, and README.MD.

├── aws_cis_v300_s1_iam
    ├── README.md            -> Standard README
    ├── common.tf            -> Policy Pack (SF) + service enabled settings
    ├── main.tf              -> Provider & Var Definitions
    └── policy_pack.tf       -> Policy Types and/or Stack settings

## File content

Q. How are the Policy Settings defined?
A. Policies should be preceded with a comment corresponding to the Guardrails policy trunk title.

- Policy Pack (SF) IDs should match the folder name e.g. `aws_cis_v300_s1_iam`
- Use `terraform fmt` to adhere to the standard HCL style guide.
- Order of fields:  
    1. resource
    2. type
    3. note
    4. value (if needed)
    5. template_input (if needed)
    6. template (if needed)
- Notes should contain a short reference to the CIS control(s) they are associated with. e.g.: `"AWS CIS v3.0.0 - Controls: 1.10 & 1.11"`
- multi-line strings should use the [indented heredoc](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/strings#indented-heredocs) `<<-EOT` style.

Q. Enforcement options for standard policies in a Policy Pack?

- All policies should be set initially to "Check: ..."
- Add additional lines into the configuration representing any appropriate "Enforce: ..." options.
- Comment out the "Enforce: ..." options using the code editor's auto comment function (Cmd-/ in VS Code).  This adds `#` in front of the first non-whitespace char in the line.  In this way when uncommented, the HCL will still align properly.

Q. Enforcement options for calculated policies in a Policy Pack?

- All calc policies should be set initially to "Check: ..."
- Add hardcoded values for check and enforce options into the template input and comment out the enforcement option. e.g.:

    ```hcl
    value: constant(value: "Check: Login profile enabled")
    # value: constant(value: "Enforce: Delete login profile")
    ```

- Use `$.value` in the calc policy template where you would normally hardcode the policy value output. e.g.:

    ```nunjucks
    {%- if (not has_mfa) or has_key -%}
    {{ $.value | json }}
    {%- else -%}
    ```  

Q. When should we include variables for a Policy Pack?
A. Avoid the use of variables unless the same value would need to be repeated in multiple parts of a template.

Q. Does every Policy Pack have a README.md?
A. Yes. Every Policy Pack should have a README.md file to clearly indicate the steps to install the Policy Pack and describe what problem it solves.

Q. What are the standard sections for a README file?

Q. Should the tfvars file always be called `default.tfvars.example`?

## README content

<!-- # README template below-->

## How to use <!-- Instructions on how to use the Policy Pack. Clear step-by-step instructions -->

Step headers should be in bold.
Links should be double checked if they render correctly, and work as expected.
