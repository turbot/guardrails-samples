This folder includes working examples, queries and integrations written using the
Turbot GraphQL API. It's intended as a resource for developers to use as a starting
point for your own integrations.

* [List all storage resources](./graphql/queries/storage-resources.graphql)
* [Full version history of a resource](./graphql/queries/resource-history.graphql)
* [List controls to investigate in states Error, Invalid or TBD](./graphql/queries/controls-to-investigate.graphql)
* [Paging through results](./graphql/queries/paging.graphql)
* [Run a control](./graphql/queries/run-control.graphql)
* [CIS controls summary (all providers, all resources)](./graphql/queries/cis-controls-summary.graphql)
* [Create a profile](./graphql/queries/create_profile.graphql)
