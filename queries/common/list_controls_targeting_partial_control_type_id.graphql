# Description
# -----------
#
# Lists all the controls that partially match the passed in control type aka.
#
# Preferred method of finding the control using the complete aka:
#   list_controls_targeting_control_type_id.graphql
#

# Usage
# -----
#
# turbot graphql --query ./list_controls_targeting_partial_control_type_id.graphql
#

# Filter
# ------
#
# controlType:
#   The control type that should be returned.
#   The matching algorithm will perform a caseless compare from right to left.
#   In example, this is set to `turbot`, which will match any item with `turbot` at the end.
#   Other possibilities are `types/iamTurbot` and `pes/iamTurbot` which will both return matches.
#   Matching `types/iamTur` will fail.
#
# controlCategoryLevel:
#   Controls which items to return from the control category hierarchy.
#   In example only items that match are returned by setting value to `self`
