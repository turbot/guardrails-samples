# Description
# -----------
#
# Lists all the controls that partially match the passed in policy type aka.
#
# Preferred method of finding the control using the complete aka:
#   list_controls_targeting_policy_type_id.graphql
#

# Usage
# -----
#
# turbot graphql --query ./list_controls_targeting_partial_policy_type_id.graphql
#

# Filter
# ------
#
# policyType:
#   The policy type that the control targets.
#   The matching algorithm will perform a caseless compare of the akas from right to left.
#   In example, this is set to `turbot`, which will match any item with `turbot` at the end.
#   Other possibilities are `categories/turbot` and `gories/turbot` which will both return matches.
#   Matching `categories/turbo` will fail.
#
# policyTypeLevel:
#   Controls the level of the policy categories that should be returned policy type hierarchy.
#   In example only items that match the policy type are returned by setting value to `self`
