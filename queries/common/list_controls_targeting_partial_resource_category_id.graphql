# Description
# -----------
#
# Lists all the controls that partially match the passed in resource category aka.
#
# Preferred method of finding the control using the complete aka:
#   list_controls_targeting_resource_category_id.graphql
#

# Usage
# -----
#
# turbot graphql --query ./list_controls_targeting_partial_resource_category_id.graphql
#

# Filter
# ------
#
# resourceCategory:
#   The resource category that the control targets.
#   The matching algorithm will perform a caseless compare of the akas from right to left.
#   In example, this is set to `turbot`, which will match any item with `turbot` at the end.
#   Other possibilities are `categories/turbot` and `gories/turbot` which will both return matches.
#   Matching `categories/turbo` will fail.
#
# resourceCategoryLevel:
#   Controls the level of the resource categories that should be returned resource category hierarchy.
#   In example only items that match the resource category are returned by setting value to `self`
