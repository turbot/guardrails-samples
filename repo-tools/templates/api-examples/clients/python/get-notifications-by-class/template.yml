title: Get notifications by notification class
description: |
  This script will return a filtered collection of notifications the notification class to filter results.

  The example has returns more data than is necessary as different fields are populated in GraphQL when using differing
  notification class values.

  | Notification class type  | Fields returned         |
  |--------------------------|-------------------------|
  | resource                 | resource                |
  | policyValue              | resource, policyValue   |
  | policySetting            | resource, policySetting |
  | control                  | resource, control       |
  | grant                    | resource, grant         |
  | activeGrant              | resource                |

  By default the script will return all notifications that were returned over the last 10 days.
