  full: |
    This script will return a filtered collection of notifications the notification class to filter results.

    The example has returns more data than is necessary as different fields are populated in GraphQL when using differing
    notification class values.

    | Notification class type  | Fields returned         |
    |--------------------------|-------------------------|
    | resource                 | resource                |
    | policyValue              | resource, policyValue   |
    | policySetting            | resource, policySetting |
    | control                  | resource, control       |
    | grant                    | resource, grant         |
    | activeGrant              | resource                |
