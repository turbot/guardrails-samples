title: Run policies in batches
description:
  short: Runs all policies in batches with a cool down period that match the end user provided filter.
  full: |
    Finds all controls matching the provided filter, then re-runs them in batches if `--execute` is set.
    After each batch the script will then enter cool down mode which will wait a number of seconds before running the 
    next batch of policies.
