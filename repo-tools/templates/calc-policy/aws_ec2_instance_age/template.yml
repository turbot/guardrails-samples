title: AWS EC2 - Set maximum age of specially tagged EC2 instances
useCase: |
  The business owner of the AWS Lab environment wants to ensure that all EC2 Lab instances 
  (instances tagged Environment:=Lab) are not being used for extended periods of time. 
  The business rule designed states that lab instances must be less than 30 days old.
details: |
  This script provides a Terraform configuration for creating a smart folder and applying a calculated policy on the 
  `AWS > EC2 > Instance > Active > Age` policy.  
  The Calculated policy sets the active age threshold to 30 days when a tag is present on the instance matching 
  {Environment:=Lab} and to skip if it is not present or set to an alternate value.
