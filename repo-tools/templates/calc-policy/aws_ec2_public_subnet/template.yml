resource: AWS EC2
description: Instance Not Approved if Public Subnet
policies:
  - AWS > EC2 > Instance > Approved
  - AWS > EC2 > Instance > Approved > Usage
useCase: |
  There is an organizational requirement that in specific accounts, no EC2 instance can be booted within a subnet with 
  an associated route table which has routes pointing to an Internet Gateway (IGW).
details: |
  Approval policy that restrict usage of EC Instances if the Subnet associated with the Instance has a Route to an IGW.
templateInput:
  details: |
    This query is two-fold. First, it finds the subnet ID contained within the EC2 instance metadata. 
    Second, all route tables in the account are found, and the associated subnet ID as well as the collection of routes.
  query: |
    {
      resource {
        subnetId: get(path: "SubnetId")
      }
      resources(filter:"resourceType:'tmod:@turbot/aws-vpc-core#/resource/types/routeTable'") {
        items {
          associations: get(path: "Associations.[0].SubnetId")
          routes: get(path: "Routes")
        }
      }
    }
template:
  details: |
    Checks each returned Route Table entry and compares it against the Subnet Id of the EC2 Instance. 
    When the Route Table entry is found then check each Route to find the Route with the id of `igw`.
    If a Route with this id is found then the usage will be set as `Not approved`.
