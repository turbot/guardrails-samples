title: AWS EC2 - Instance Not Approved if Public Subnet
useCase: |
  There is an organizational requirement that in specific accounts, no EC2 instance can be booted within a subnet with 
  an associated route table which has routes pointing to an Internet Gateway (IGW).
details: |
  This script provides a Terraform configuration for creating a smart folder and applying a calculated policy using 
  `AWS > EC2 > Instance > Approved > Usage` policy and then setting `AWS > EC2 > Instance > Approved` to check.
templateInput:
  details: |
    This query is two-fold. First, it finds the subnet ID contained within the EC2 instance metadata. 
    Second, all route tables in the account are found, and the associated subnet ID as well as the collection of routes.
  query: |
    {
      resource {
        subnetId: get(path: "SubnetId")
      }
      resources(filter:"resourceType:'tmod:@turbot/aws-vpc-core#/resource/types/routeTable'") {
        items {
          associations: get(path: "Associations.[0].SubnetId")
          routes: get(path: "Routes")
        }
      }
    }
