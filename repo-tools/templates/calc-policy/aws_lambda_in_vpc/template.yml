title: AWS Lambda - Approve a Lambda function only if it is within a particular VPC
useCase: |
  The business owner of the AWS environment wants to ensure that a Lambda is only ran from within a VPC, not within the
  AWS network.
details: |
  This script provides a Terraform configuration for creating a smart folder and applying a calculated policy on the 
  `AWS > Lambda > Function > Approved > Usage` policy.  
  The Calculated policy checks the Lambda metadata for existence of the attribute VpcConfig and can be expanded to check
  for a specific VPC Id or Subnet Ids.
templateInput:

      }
    }
template:

    {% if $.resource.vpc.VpcId %}
      "Approved"
    {% else %}
      "Not Approved"
