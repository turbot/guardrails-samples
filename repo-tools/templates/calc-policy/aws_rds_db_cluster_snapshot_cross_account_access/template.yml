title: AWS RDS DB Cluster - Restrict Cross Account Snapshots by user defined Whitelist
useCase: |
  Cluster Snapshot set to `Not approved` if cross account access exists to an account not in a whitelist.
details: |
  Use the AWS > RDS > DB Cluster Snapshot [Manual] > Approved > Usage policy.
  Calculated policy for policy `AWS > RDS > DB Cluster Snapshot [Manual] > Approved > Usage` policy.
  If the account that the snapshot is shared with, given by the property `DBClusterSnapshotAttributes.AttributeValues`
templateInput:
  details: |
    GraphQL query that will return all the shared account details to compare against a whitelist to ensure that the
    snapshot is valid.
  query: |
    {
      dbClusterSnapshotManual 
      {
        sharedAccounts: get(path:"DBClusterSnapshotAttributes.AttributeValues")
      }
    }
template:
  details: |
    Add items to the currently empty `whitelist` collection as detailed in inline example comments.
    The Nunjucks script will then check if all the accounts that are shared with the snapshot are valid by comparing 
    entries from a whitelist of accounts.

    To add entries to the whitelist can be done in two different ways:
    - Using `defaults.tf`
    - Amending the list in Turbot UI

    #### Using `defaults.tf`
    **Recommended**
    Add the entries into the file as a list of accounts. 
    When running the script it will add these entries into the Calculated Policy automatically and allow the end 
    user to control the accounts centrally.

    #### Amending the list in Turbot UI
    If the company workflow is to modify the Calculated Policy directly in Turbot. 
    Navigate to the policy and amend the template value by adding entries into the `whitelist` Nunjucks array. 
    For example, suppose two accounts should be added, "012345678901", "109876543210", this can be added by setting
    the variable by:

    ```nunjucks
    {#- set whitelist = ["012345678901", "109876543210"] -#}
    ```

    **Note:** All the accounts that are being shared by the snapshot need to have an entry in the whitelist in order
    for the snapshot to be valid, otherwise it will be invalid and set to `Not approved`.
