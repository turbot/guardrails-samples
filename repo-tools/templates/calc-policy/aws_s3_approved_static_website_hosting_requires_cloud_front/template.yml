resource: AWS S3 Bucket
description: Enforce static website hosting is associated with CloudFront
policies:
  - AWS > Region > Bucket > Approved
  - AWS > Region > Bucket > Approved > Usage
useCase: |
  This control is specifically for the Static Website Buckets. 
  End-users should not be able to directly access the S3 bucket endpoint.
  A static hosted S3 bucket must be associated with a CloudFront distribution.
  In addition, that CloudFront distribution needs to enforce that access to the website uses the protocol HTTPS 
  only.

  Provides a Terraform configuration for creating a smart folder and applying a calculated policy on the 
  `AWS> S3> Bucket> Tags> Template`.
  The Calculated policy creates a tag template.
  The template shows creating static and dynamic values.
  It also shows how to control the values of tags on a bucket.

    The query below is a two fold query, which functions as a JOIN in SQL. 
    Initially, get the name of the current S3 bucket. 
    Using this bucket name, do a subsequent query to get the associated CloudFront distribution using the 
    bucket name as a part of the lookup key.

        item: bucket {
          Name

    Initially set the policy value to `Approved` to allow for normal S3 bucket usage. 
    If the S3 bucket is configured as a static website then we need to do some additional checks.

    The code checks to see that the default cache behaviour has a viewer protocol policy that is set to HTTPS usage and 
    will not allow HTTP usage.
    If not, then we set the policy to `Not approved`.

    Then next section will check to see that the addition cache behaviour has a viewer protocol policy that is set to 
    HTTPS usage and will not allow HTTP usage.
    If not, then we set the policy to `Not approved`.

    Otherwise the S3 bucket will be `Approved`.
