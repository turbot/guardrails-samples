## Calculated Policies

Provides templates for implementing calculated policies. 

Calculated policies allow Turbot administrators to modify or extend the default behavior and logic that Turbot uses to evaluate controls.

The calculated policy examples are implemented with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) allowing you to manage and 
provision Turbot with a repeatable, idempotent, versioned infrastructure-as-code approach.

### Current Calculated Policies

| Path | Resource | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
{%- for calcPolicy in configuration.calcPolicies %}
| [{{ calcPolicy.name }}](./{{ calcPolicy.name }}/README.md) | {{ calcPolicy.resource }} | {{ calcPolicy.description }} |
{%- endfor %}

## Prerequisites

To run Turbot Calculated Policies, you must install:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) Version 12
- [Turbot Terraform Provider](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/reference/terraform/provider)
- Configured credentials to connect to your Turbot workspace

### Configuring Credentials

You must set your `config.tf` or environment variables to connect to your Turbot workspace.
Further information can be found in the Turbot Terraform Provider [Installation Instructions](https://turbot.com/v5/docs/reference/terraform/provider).

### Structure

Calculated Polices are implemented as independently deployable terraform configurations and are organised as 
sub-directories within this repository.

Commonly changed parameters are implemented using variables. 
Most variables have default values, but these values assigned to these variables can be overwritten by the end user. 

Each Calculated Policy folder contains:

- `variables.tf` containing the variable definitions

- `main.tf` containing the terraform resources that creates the objects

- `default.tfvars` containing the defaults for the variables

- `README.md` detailing the Calculated Policy and usage information

```

### Style Guide

Our Calculate Policies adopts styling conventions provided by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/style.html) 
like:

- Align the equal to signs for arguments appearing on consecutive lines with values.
- Variables should use snake case: `this_is_an_example`
- Use empty lines to separate logical groups of arguments within a block.

To maintain consistency between files and modules, we recommend adopting the below added styling conventions:

- For each Calculated Policy, include the variable definitions in the variables.tf file, the resources in main.tf file, 
  and the output in outputs.tf file.
- For `turbot_policy_setting` and `turbot_policy_value` resources, include the policy type hierarchy in a comment 
  before the resource. For example:

  ```terraform
  # AWS > Account > Turbot IAM Role > External ID
  resource "turbot_policy_setting" "turbotIamRoleExternalId" {
    resource    = turbot_resource.account_resource.id
    type        = "tmod:@turbot/aws#/policy/types/turbotIamRoleExternalId"
    value       = var.turbot_external_id
  }
  ```

- Use a single hash for comments that refer only to a single resource, immediately before the resource, for example:

  ```terraform
  # 1.4 Ensure access keys are rotated every 90 days or less (Scored)
  # AWS > IAM > Access Key > Active > Age
  # Setting value to "Force inactive if age > 90" days to meet remediation
  resource "turbot_policy_setting" "AWS_IAM_AccessKey_Active_Age" {
    resource    = var.target_resource
    type        = "tmod:@turbot/aws-iam#/policy/types/accessKeyActiveAge"
    value       = "Force inactive if age > 90 days"
  }
  ```

- Use 4 hashes for comments that describe a group of resources, or general behavior:

  ```terraform
  #### Set the credentials (Role, external id) for the account via Turbot policies
  ```

- All variables should have a description, and as a result should not require individual comments

- Most variables should have a reasonable default

- Where Calculated Policies apply policies, they generally should use a variable for the target resource
  
  - it should be called target_resource
  - it should default to "tmod:@turbot/turbot#/"
  - it should have a comment that states that it may be changes or overridden
  
  ```terraform
  variable "target_resource" {
      type    = "string"
      description = "Enter the target resource id or aka"
      default = "tmod:@turbot/turbot#/"
  }
  ```
