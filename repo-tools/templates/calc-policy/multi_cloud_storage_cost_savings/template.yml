resource: Multi-Cloud Storage
description: Set least expensive storage options for development environments
policies:
  - Azure > Storage > Storage Account > Access Tier
  - AWS > S3 > Bucket > Versioning
useCase: |
  The business owner of the AWS and Azure cloud platforms who wants to save cost by ensuring that the configuration of 
  storage resources are optimized for cost savings in development accounts. 

  By setting the tag or label as {Environment:=Dev} on storage resources will allow Turbot to the manage the resource 
  under the governance of this business rule.
details: |
  For Azure, the calculated policy sets the storage tier to "Cool" when an Azure label matching {Environment:=Dev} is 
  present on a storage account resource

  For AWS, the calculated policy disables S3 versioning when an AWS tag matching {Environment:=Dev} is present on an 
  S3 bucket resource.

  **NOTE:** Rule currently manages Azure and AWS resources only.

    In this case the query selects all tags from the storage account which will be used to determine if the resource
    should be managed by this business rule.

    { 
      resource {
        tags
      }

    First Nunjucks snippet determines if the storage account resource is deployed in a development environment. 
    If it is then it will set the Storage Access Tier to `Enforce: Cool` otherwise it will remain `Enforce: Hot`.

    Second Nunjucks snippet determines if the S3 Bucket account resource is deployed in a development environment.
    If it is then it will set Versioning to `Enforce: Disabled` otherwise it will remain `Enforce: Enabled`.
