title: Multi-Cloud Storage / Set least expensive storage options for development environments.
useCase: |
  The business owner of the AWS and Azure cloud platforms who wants to save cost by ensuring that the configuration of 
  storage resources are optimized for cost savings in development accounts. 

  By setting the tag or label as {Environment:=Dev} on storage resources will allow Turbot to the manage the resource 
  under the governance of this business rule.

  NOTE: Rule currently manages Azure and AWS resources only.

  This Terraform template creates a smart folder and applies a calculated policies on the policies:
  - `Azure > Storage > Storage Account > Access Tier`
  - `AWS > S3 > Bucket > Versioning`

  For Azure, the calculated policy sets the storage tier to "Cool" when an Azure label matching {Environment:=Dev} is 
  present on a storage account resource

  For AWS, the calculated policy disables S3 versioning when an AWS tag matching {Environment:=Dev} is present on an 
  S3 bucket resource.

    The template input to a calculated policy is a GraphQL query.  

    In this case the query selects all tags from the storage account which will be used to determine if the resource
    should be managed by this business rule.
